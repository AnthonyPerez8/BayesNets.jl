# TODO use the metric that the paper used, maybe also use KL divergence

# One Discrete univariate distribution (one discrete variable)

# Discrete only

# Compare against exact distribution (variable elimination), random table weighted, and rejection

# Discrete with unlikely events

# One continuous distribution

# One continuous distribution that is multimodal (Mixture of Gaussians)

# Hybrid - Two Gaussians

# Hybrid with unlikely events

# Hybrid (Complex)
